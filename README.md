# What is Windows Security Hardening?
Windows Security Hardening is a set of steps used to improve the security of a Windows system. It includes enabling built-in protections like the firewall and antivirus, disabling risky features like remote access, and keeping the system updated. These actions protect the computer from viruses, hackers, and other threats.

# Password Manager
A password manager securely stores and manages strong, unique passwords. It helps prevent weak or reused passwords and makes account management safer.

# Windows Hardening Checklist
Enable Windows Defender and Firewall: Protects against viruses, malware, and network-based attacks by monitoring traffic and blocking suspicious activities.

Enforce Strong Password Policies: Require users to create complex passwords with minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. This reduces the risk of password guessing or brute-force attacks.

Disable Unused Services (e.g., Remote Desktop if not needed): Services that are not in use can become entry points for attackers. Disabling them minimizes the attack surface.

Install Latest Security Updates:Regular updates patch vulnerabilities in Windows and applications, ensuring attackers cannot exploit known weaknesses.

Use BitLocker for Encryption: Encrypts the entire disk to protect sensitive files. Even if a device is stolen, the data remains secure without the decryption key.

Enable User Account Control (UAC): Prevents unauthorized system changes by requiring admin approval when installing software or modifying critical settings.

Turn On Audit Logging: Keeps track of user and system activities. Logs help detect suspicious behavior and support investigations during security incidents.

Restrict External Device Access (like USB drives): Prevents malware infections and data theft through removable media by blocking or controlling device usage.

Take Regular Backups: Ensures data can be recovered after hardware failures, ransomware attacks, or accidental deletions. Backups should be stored securely, preferably offline or in the cloud.
